    "# Increased efficiency: APIs allow for automation and integration between different systems, making processes faster\n",
    "# and more efficient.\n",
    "#  Better user experience: APIs allow developers to create applications that can easily access and integrate\n",
    "# with other systems,\n",
    "# resulting in a better user experience.\n",
    "# Reduced development time: APIs can simplify the development process, allowing developers to focus on other aspects \n",
    "# of the application.\n",
    "# Flexibility: APIs allow for the creation of modular systems that can be easily updated or changed as needed.\n",
    "# Disadvantages of using API:\n",
    "# Complexity: APIs can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for non-technical users.\n",
    "# Security concerns: APIs can create security vulnerabilities if not properly secured, as they allow\n",
